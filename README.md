## Overview

### Manual

To install this integration manually you have to download [_divera.zip_](https://github.com/fwmarcel/home-assistant-divera/releases/latest/download/divera.zip) and extract its contents to `config/custom_components/divera` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p custom_components/divera
cd custom_components/divera
wget https://github.com/fwmarcel/home-assistant-divera/releases/latest/download/divera.zip
unzip divera.zip
rm divera.zip
```

## Configuration

### Using UI

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=divera)

From the Home Assistant front page go to `Configuration` and then select `Devices & Services` from the list.
Use the `Add Integration` button in the bottom right to add a new integration called `Divera 24/7`.

A dialog appears in which your access key must be entered.
You can also change the server address if you are hosting Divera Server in your own.
In the next step, you can select the units you are a member of.

### How do you get your required access key?

1. Open the settings [website](https://app.divera247.com/account/einstellungen.html) of divera.
2. Change to the debug tab.
3. Copy your accesskey

## Usage

Once the integration is set up and configured, you can use it to monitor and manage your own availability in Home Assistant.
Access the Divera 24/7 entities from your Home Assistant dashboard to view availability status, receive alerts, and trigger actions as needed.

The entities are updated every minute by default.
If a more frequent update is required, this must be implemented using the `homeassistant.update_entity` service itself. However, I do not recommend this.

### Entities

This integration provides entities for the following information from Divera 24/7:

- the last visible alarm.
- the current status of the user.

## Automation Blueprint

You can add a basic automation blueprint here:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffwmarcel%2Fhome-assistant-divera%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fdivera-blueprint.yaml)
